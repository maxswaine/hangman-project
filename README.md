# Hangman

The classic and simple game you know and love, recreated in one of the most complicated ways using Java!

Players start the game, and choose their difficulty (in terms of how many goes you get to guess the word and not the length of the word itself). It is then up to you to guess the right word before the man is hung. 

At the end, players can either choose to start again or quit the game entirely.

## Run Locally

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/maxswaine/hangman-project.git

Open with IntelliJ and run the code in Main.

## Lessons Learned

This project helped me understand basic structuring of OOP Projects. I have learned the fundamentals of the Four Pillars of OOP such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
